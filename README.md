## square game desktop java ##

there is database connection

you see the winner at the end of the game

you can select the grid size of the game area (from 2* 2 to 11 *11 squares)

you see your score and your opponent's score on each turn

your gameplay data like which line you pressed is stored in the database on each move

As well as the winner is also stored in the database at the end of the game. Regardless whether a game is finished, all gameplay data with its sessionId is stored there.

I used SQlite for database connection
